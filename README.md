# 🎓 Akademia

Welcome to **Akademia** — my digital notebook, project archive, and creative workshop for all things college.  
This repository holds assignments, projects, and experiments from my journey through computer science and beyond.

## 📚 Purpose
Akademia exists to:
- Organize coursework and projects in one place  
- Track my growth and learning over time  
- Showcase my academic and technical work  

---

## 🧠 Contents
Expect to find:
- `assignments/` → class tasks, reports, and exercises  
- `projects/` → bigger builds, group work, and personal experiments  
- `notes/` → references, snippets, and thoughts I don’t want to lose

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
Depending on the semester and mood, you’ll see:
- Python / Java / C++  
- Web development (HTML, CSS, JS, React maybe 👀)  
- Data structures, algorithms, and other academic magic

## 💭 Philosophy
> “Learning isn’t about grades — it’s about building things that make you think.”

Akademia is a space for curiosity, not perfection. Expect messy code, random sparks of brilliance, and maybe a few all-nighter commits.
